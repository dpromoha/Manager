# manager

Just imagine, perfect minimalistic app, that allows you to plan, set everyday goals, count money, and even help to focus on the most difficult challenges. Sounds good? I think so. 
You can get all of this after registration! Just use your email, think of a complex password and the whole **"Manager"** is yours. Privacy is one of the strong part of this app because all you can add about yourself are name and age. Don`t like a **"Manager"** anymore? Delete your account and personal information will be deleted.

Confused about your life plan? Add all you have to remember in the Tasks part of "Manager". Sort, done, delete, and focus on your incredible goals. Also, if you need a calendar for events or holidays, you have it in one tap.

The most sensitive subject for everyone is money. It is very interesting to understand for what you used the biggest part of the wage. Control your earning and spending in the **"Manager"**. Also, you have the opportunity to see the current currency exchange for the most popular currencies in the world.

For completing all of these daily tasks you need to focus on. A lot of people know about the Pomodoro Technique, where 25 minutes is the standart focus timer. In **"Manager"** you have more freedom: 15 minutes (for rapid daily task), classic 25 minutes, and 35 (for the difficult goal). After you start, you can`t stop the timer, only press "Give up". The important thing to remember that your actions are recorded for the statistic. You can see all of your winning and losing.

To build this useful app I used:
- Firebase (Auth & Firestore);
